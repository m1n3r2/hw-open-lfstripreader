# Open source lateral flow strip reader
This repo is made for our open-source lateral flow strip reader project. The project was originally created for our paper titled [Development of Automated Detection and Wireless Reporting for a Handheld Point-of-Care Test](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9276773/). In the paper you can find a detailed performance analysis of the original hardware. To build the device you will need in-depth knowledge of electronics, as well as a decent FDM 3D printer such as the [Original Prusa i3 MK3S](https://shop.prusa3d.com/en/3d-printers/180-original-prusa-i3-mk3s-kit.html).
